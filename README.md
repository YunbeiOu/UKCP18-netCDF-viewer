# UKCP18 netCDF viewer
Web address: [https://yunbeiou.github.io/UKCP18-netCDF-viewer/]

## Project detail
This project visualize climate projections in the UK in a web map, covering 100 years of climate projections from 1980-2080. There are 17 climate variables available, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, snowfall, etc.

## Data
The data is downloaded from [CEDA archive: UKCP Local Projections at 2.2 km Resolution for 1980-2080](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/d5822183143c4011a2bb304ee7c0baf7).

## Code
The codes here include python codes for data pre-processing and web technologies for web map developing, highly reproducible for similar work on visualizing NetCDF data (e.g. UKCP18) in web map.
